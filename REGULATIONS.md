### Wording

Uses of the uppercase words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" match the guidance in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119) Updated by [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8174).

The Acronym RTO stands for 'Retro Tournaments Organization'.
The Acronym STA stands for 'Simultaneous Time Attack'; is defined as a race where all competitors in a given heat start simultaneously on the same frame rule and score points based on the place they finish the game.
The Acronym LTA stands for 'Live Time Attack'; is defined as a race where all competitors are given a limited timeframe to post their fastest time.  Competitors are allowed unlimited resets as-long-as the last trial starts 00:01 before the time limit expires.
The rules established for LTA and RTA will be applicable for any% - (1-1, 1-2, 4-1, 4-2, 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4) and Warpless (all 32 stages).
